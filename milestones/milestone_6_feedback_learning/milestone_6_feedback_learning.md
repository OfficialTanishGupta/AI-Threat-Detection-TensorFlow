## 🔴 Milestone 6: Alert System & Feedback Learning

### 📌 Objective
To convert behavior predictions into **actionable alerts**
and enable continuous system improvement through feedback learning.

---

### 🚨 Alert Logic
- System monitors behavior per frame
- Alerts are triggered when behavior is:
  - Suspicious
  - Dangerous

This logic can be connected to:
- SMS APIs
- Police control rooms
- CCTV monitoring dashboards

---

### 📊 Event Logging
Each alert is logged with:
- Frame number
- Motion features
- Predicted behavior

This enables:
- Evidence tracking
- False-positive analysis
- Model retraining

---

### 🧠 Feedback Learning
Human-reviewed logs can be relabeled and reused to:
- Retrain ANN model
- Reduce false alarms
- Improve real-world accuracy

---

### 🏙️ CCTV Deployment Architecture
Camera → Video Feed → Pose Detection → ANN → Alert System → Authorities

---

### 📈 Status
✅ Alert logic implemented  
✅ Event logging working  
✅ Feedback learning designed  
✅ Project completed
