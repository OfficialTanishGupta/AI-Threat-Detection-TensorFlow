# AI-Based Threat Detection & Behavior Analysis System

## 📌 Overview

This project aims to build an AI-powered system that can analyze live video footage, detect objects held by individuals, understand human movement and behavior, and identify potential public safety threats.

The system is designed for real-world use cases such as:

- CCTV surveillance
- Public safety monitoring
- Smart city infrastructure

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Objects like knives or stones do not always indicate criminal intent.
This project focuses on **behavior-aware AI**, which analyzes:

- Objects in hand
- Human pose and movement
- Activity patterns over time

to determine whether a situation is **safe, suspicious, or dangerous**.

## 🧠 Core Features

- Live video frame analysis
- Object detection using TensorFlow
- Human pose and movement analysis
- ANN-based behavior classification
- Feedback-based learning system
- Alert mechanism for potential threats

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- MediaPipe
- Android (CameraX)
- Flask (Backend API)
